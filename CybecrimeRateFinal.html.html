    <h2>Cybercrime Rates in the World</h2>
    <p>Explore the cybercrime rates in various countries across the globe. The map displays different countries with their respective cybercrime rates indicated by marker colors. The colors are indicative of the severity of cybercrime, with darker shades representing higher rates. The map displays the cybercrime rate for each country and how it has affected the country drastically. The cybercrime rate statistics show that there are 2,200 attacks per day, with a cyberattack happening every 39 seconds on average. These cyberattacks have affected every country economically. The map shows the different rates of cyberattack in each country. The global cyber security landscape has seen increased threats in recent years. Through the pandemic, cyber criminals took advantage of misaligned networks as businesses moved to remote work environments. In 2020, malware attacks increased 358% compared to 2019. From here, cyber attacks globally increased by 125% through 2021, and increasing volumes of cyber attacks continued to threaten businesses and individuals in 2022.Today, the world is more digitally connected than ever before. Criminals take advantage of this online transformation to target weaknesses in online systems, networks and infrastructure. There is a massive economic and social impact on governments, businesses and individuals worldwide.Phishing, ransomware and data breaches are just a few examples of current cyberthreats, while new types of cybercrime are emerging all the time. Cybercriminals are increasingly agile and organized – exploiting new technologies, tailoring their attacks and cooperating in new ways. Cybercrimes know no national borders. Criminals, victims and technical infrastructure span multiple jurisdictions, bringing many challenges to investigations and prosecutions. </p>

    <h2>Effects of each country</h2>
    <p>The cybercrime rates of each country show the statistics describing which country shows the most cybercrime rate and the lowest cybercrime rate. As you can see from the graph, the highest rate happens to be United Kingdom (70%) and the lowest happens to be Australia (15%). This data shows that no matter the cybercrime rate, the economic conditions of the country are still affected by the rate of cybercrime happening around. The damage done is affecting individuals, businesses, and societies on a large scale.Studies show that most victims of cyber-hacking come from the world's most developed countries, including the United States, China, Japan, and Germany. Although some major cyber-attacks are government sponsored, such as the Sony attack which was allegedly supported by North Korea, the majority of attacks occur against private citizens and are connected to the theft of personal information. Regarding the international system as a whole, cyber-attacks cause a major stumbling block for global economic growth due to its detrimental effects on innovation and the theft of ideas. Many small businesses without adequate protection are hacked without any knowledge of the act until their sales greatly suffer years later due to competitors gaining knowledge of the company's logistics, target markets, or personal information.In the words of the FBI, cybercrime is a complex global concern involving criminals and nation-states aiming to compromise networks, disrupt critical infrastructure, and steal money and intellectual property.The FBI cites economic espionage as a major concern. Sponsored by foreign powers, economic espionage seeks to illegally influence a country’s economic policy or steal critical technologies or sensitive data relating to a country’s finance, trade, or economic policy.
It’s difficult to quantify the true cost of cybercrime because its scope is so large, and the standards and definitions are so varied, as are ways of measuring its economic impact.</p>

    <h2>Cybercrime Rate Comparison</h2>
    <p>This line chart shows the comparison of cybercrime rates in different countries over the years. As you can see from the graph, one interesting fact is that the cybercrime rate in each year is fluctuating, which shows that the cybercrime rate increases with a rate of 40% each year, spiking up the rate in each country present in that year. As you can see, the highest cybercrime rate was present in the year 2012, spiking up to a value of 70% of the total people's population in the country United Kingdom. It shows us that out of the total population of the United Kingdom, which was 63.7 million, 70% of the people were affected by this cybercrime happening around them.There were 153 million new malware samples from March 2021 to February 2022 (AV-Test), a nearly 5% increase on the previous year which saw 145.8 million.In 2019, 93.6% of malware observed was polymorphic, meaning it has the ability to constantly change its code to evade detection (2020 Webroot Threat Report)Almost 50% of business PCs and 53% of consumer PCs that got infected once were re-infected within the same year (2021 Webroot Threat Report).A 2011 study found that malicious hackers were previously attacking computers and networks at a rate of one attack every 39 seconds. The Internet Crime Complaint Center’s 2020 report found that there were 465,177 reported incidents that year, which works out at one successful attack every 1.12 seconds. Notably, this doesn’t account for attempted attacks or those that went unreported.86.2% of surveyed organizations were aﬀected by a successful cyberattack.More then 1000 groups of Ransomware attacks have conquered over these millions of people affecting them harshly in the years between(2010-2023).</p>

    <h2>Lowest Rates in the world </h2>
    <p>The lowest Crime Rate in the world is being displayed where the top five countries having the crime rate less than 30% is shown. In these specific countries shown on the map, the crime rate happens to be between the range 15%-28% of the total people's population of their respective countries. In each country, a crime rate score varying between 0%-70% is assigned, and if the country's crime rate score is considered less than 30%, those specific countries are less likely to have a cybercrime attack. The cybercrime statistics also show how the cybercrime attack rate decreases throughout the years of these specific countries.Developing countries are more vulnerable compared to the developed countries for a cyberattack.These countries show less number of attacks compared to the rest of the countries is because these countries are already developed and are financially and economically stable in their total net worth of their global economy.The developing countriues are attacked more because financially they are not stable due to which attacks become very easier on them. According to the reports during the yeat between 2018-20223 these top five countries were not attacked that much as compared to the other countries this is because there were already developed and were balancing out in the financial ecomony and global economy.But yet all countries are always in sight of target to the attackers that wanna put in a cyberattack and drastically reduce the countries economy. In some cases cyberattacks are being used by countries at each over as a sign of war to takeover the country.The disadvantage of developed countries is that they become vulnerable for a warframe against them by another country. Therefore it gives us the reason on why these countries were not attacked more compared to the other countries.</p>
